// IDEA BEHIND MY STYLING
// Every element gets 100% with, this is my solution to make custom components' width equal to 100%
// in every created component the parent div has "full-width-flex-container" which again has with of 100%
// and now every component is wrapped in <component-name>-container where i can set the with to whatever percantage i want
// it also allows to set min and max width to that container which in my opinion creates neat environment for responsive design
// But it also has downsides i am not sure if it will be so comfortable to style nested custom components, but this is my first
// bigger app so i might change this approach later, at this point of development i am going to use this comment as guide

.full-width-flex-container {
  width: 100%;
