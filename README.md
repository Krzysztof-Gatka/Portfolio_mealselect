This is my first bigger project. It's main purpose was to teach me basics of Angular and Front End in general.
During development I've made many mistakes, some of them are fixed and some are still in codebase, but I think
it reflects my current level. I am learning new things every day and already have an idea for next project
I want to make it much more professional than this one and i will have to improve my skills:
  - CSS -> responsive layout design, using preprocessor, app performance
  - Angular -> I know that i am using only fracture of Angular capabilities
  - Testing 
  
  
What I've learnt:
  - DON'T use temporary solutions, instead write code in right way at the beggining
  - Think about layout and color pallete at the beginning of project development
  - Make your commits descriptive and short
  - Think about functionalities and views at the beginning to create Angular Component for it to not repeat yourself
